    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Lasagna is a classic Italian dish made of layers of pasta, sauce, cheese, and various fillings. Traditionally, it consists of wide,
         flat pasta sheets layered with a rich meat or vegetable sauce, such as a Bolognese, and a creamy b√©chamel or ricotta cheese mixture.
          The dish is often topped with melted mozzarella or Parmesan cheese and baked until bubbly and golden.

        Originating from Italy, lasagna is a hearty and comforting meal enjoyed worldwide. Its versatility allows for numerous variations,
         including vegetarian options with layers of roasted vegetables or seafood. Each layer melds together during baking, creating
          a flavorful and satisfying casserole.
